In this article, we will show you how to watch Shaolin Soccer in 1080p with English audio, using various streaming platforms and download options. We will also compare the different versions of the film and explain which one is the best for you.
  
## Streaming Platforms
 
One of the easiest ways to watch Shaolin Soccer in full HD with English audio is to use a streaming platform that offers the film. However, not all streaming platforms have the same version of the film, so you need to check which one suits your preferences.
 
Here are some of the streaming platforms that have Shaolin Soccer available:
 
- **Netflix**: Netflix has the US version of the film, which is dubbed in English and has a runtime of 87 minutes. This version cuts out some scenes and adds some new ones, such as a flashback to Sing's childhood and a rap song during the credits. Some fans prefer this version because it has more jokes and references to American culture, while others dislike it because it changes the original tone and plot of the film.
- **Amazon Prime Video**: Amazon Prime Video has the international version of the film, which is also dubbed in English and has a runtime of 112 minutes. This version is closer to the original version, but still has some edits and changes. For example, it removes some scenes that are considered too violent or vulgar for Western audiences, such as Sing's nosebleed or Mui's hairy legs. It also adds some new scenes, such as a montage of Sing training his brothers and a cameo by Jackie Chan.
- **Hulu**: Hulu has the original version of the film, which is in Cantonese and Mandarin with English subtitles and has a runtime of 113 minutes. This version is the most faithful to Stephen Chow's vision and has all the scenes that were cut or altered in other versions. However, some viewers might find it hard to follow the dialogue or appreciate the humor if they are not familiar with Chinese language and culture.

Depending on your location, you might need a VPN to access some of these streaming platforms or watch certain versions of the film. A VPN is a service that allows you to change your IP address and appear as if you are in another country. This way, you can bypass geo-restrictions and enjoy more content online.
